                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F, grease an 8x8 baking pan, then prep your ingredients and utensils.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients. Combine the dry ingredients in a separate bowl, then fold them into your wet ingredients 1/3 at a time to evenly incorporate.</li>
                    <li>Next, bake your oats for 35–45 minutes. Since your oven's temperature might differ from mine, I suggest checking them after 35 minutes. They're ready to go when the center is still slightly jiggly but not overly so, which results in a soft and moist bite. If you prefer a denser, drier texture, let it bake for the full 45 minutes.</li>
                    <li>For best results, leave the oats in the baking pan and let them rest on a cooling rack for 1 hour. You can eat them sooner if you'd like, but I find the texture more favorable at room temp or even refrigerated.</li>
                </ol>
