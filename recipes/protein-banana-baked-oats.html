    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oats – 120 grams</li>
        <li>Whey Protein – 15 grams</li>
        <li>Casein Protein – 15 grams</li>
        <li>Cinnamon Powder – 5 grams</li>
        <li>Baking Powder – 3 grams</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt (Diamond Crystal) – 1.5 grams</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Wet</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>Bananas – 200 grams</li>
        <li>Milk (your preference) – 236 grams</li>
        <li>Whole Eggs – 55 grams</li>
        <li>Maple Syrup – 45 grams</li>
        <li>Vanilla Bean Paste – 7 grams</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F, grease an 8x8 baking pan, and then prep your ingredients and utensils.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients. Combine the dry ingredients in a separate bowl, and then fold them into your wet ingredients 1/3 at a time to evenly incorporate.</li>
        <li>Next, bake your oats for 35–45 minutes. Since your oven's temperature might differ from mine, I suggest checking them after 35 minutes. They're ready to go when the center is still slightly jiggly but not overly so, which results in a soft and moist bite. If you prefer a denser, drier texture, let it bake for the full 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>For best results, leave the oats in the baking pan and let them rest on a cooling rack for 1 hour. You can eat them sooner if you'd like, but I find the texture is more favorable at room temp or even refrigerated.</li>
    </ol>
