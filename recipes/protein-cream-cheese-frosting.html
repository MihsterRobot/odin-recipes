                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This protein cream cheese frosting blends Greek yogurt and cream cheese for a smooth, tangy base, enhanced with a balanced mix of whey and casein protein to add structure, richness, and extra protein without compromising texture. A small pinch of salt sharpens the flavor and keeps the frosting from tasting flat, resulting in a creamy, lightly sweet spread that’s thick enough for piping yet soft enough to swirl. Ideal for topping baked oats, cakes, or muffins, it delivers classic cream cheese flavor with a more filling, protein-forward profile.</p>
